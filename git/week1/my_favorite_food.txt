Oatmeal Cookies:
Ingredients for Easy Oatmeal Cookies
Old fashioned oats. Don’t use quick oats here or the texture won’t come out the same. Plus they absorb differently so cookies may end up dry.
All-purpose flour. Bleached or unbleached flour will work here.
Baking powder and baking soda. The blend of the two offers cookies with just enough lift.
Cinnamon. If you’d like additional spice flavor add in 1/4 tsp nutmeg and ginger too.
Salt. Don’t leave this out or cookies will taste flat.
Unsalted butter. Careful not to soften butter fully. Semi-firm butter will help cookies spread less.
Light brown sugar and granulated sugar. The combination gives a soft chewy cookie, and the brown sugar adds a light caramel-y flavor.
Eggs. These bind everything together. Use cold eggs so cookies spread less.
Vanilla. You could also use vanilla bean paste here as well.
Raisins. A freshly opened package will give best results, just don’t use some that are all super dry.
Walnuts. Optional, but who doesn’t love the additional chewy crunch to pair with the oats?
